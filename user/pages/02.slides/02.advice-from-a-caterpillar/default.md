## Advice from a Caterpillar

---

It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself

> The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where *can* I have dropped them, I wonder?

---

The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.

> ‘Who are *you* ?’ said the Caterpillar.

This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, ‘I— I hardly know, sir, just at present — at least I know who I *was* when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.’

---

> ‘What do you mean by that?’ said the Caterpillar sternly. ‘Explain yourself!’

> ‘I can’t explain *myself* , I’m afraid, sir’ said Alice, ‘because I’m not myself, you see.’

> ‘I don’t see,’ said the Caterpillar.

> ‘I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,’ Alice replied very politely, ‘for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.’

---

> ‘It isn’t,’ said the Caterpillar.

> ‘When you have to turn into a chrysalis and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little queer, won’t you?’

> ‘Not a bit,’ said the Caterpillar.

> ‘Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,’ said Alice; ‘all I know is, it would feel very queer to *me* .’

> ‘You!’ said the Caterpillar contemptuously. ‘Who are *you* ?’
