The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good- natured, she thought: still it had *very* long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

Alice said,

> ‘Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?’

> ‘That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,’ said the Cat.

> ‘I don’t much care where —’ said Alice.

> ‘Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,’ said the Cat.

---

> ‘— so long as I get *somewhere* ,’ Alice added as an explanation.

> ‘Oh, you’re sure to do that,’ said the Cat, ‘if you only walk long enough.’

> Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. ‘What sort of people live about here?’

> ‘In *that* direction,’ the Cat said, waving its right paw round, ‘lives a Hatter: and in *that* direction,’ waving the other paw, ‘lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.’

---

> ‘But I don’t want to go among mad people,’ Alice remarked.

> ‘Oh, you can’t help that,’ said the Cat: ‘we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.’

> ‘How do you know I’m mad?’ said Alice.

> ‘You must be,’ said the Cat, ‘or you wouldn’t have come here.’
