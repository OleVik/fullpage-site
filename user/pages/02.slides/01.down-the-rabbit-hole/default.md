There was nothing so *very* remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so *very* much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,

Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with a waistcoat-pocket, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
